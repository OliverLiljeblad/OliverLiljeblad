### 🧠 About Me  
I’m a curious developer and student who enjoys building things that blend **data, math, and logic** — whether that’s in **machine learning**, **finance**, or **quantitative analysis**.  

I like solving problems, learning new tools, and turning ideas into projects that actually work.  
Also: clean code > clever code 😄
